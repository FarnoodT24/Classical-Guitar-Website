<!-- This is the HTML content for the popup image. It is organized it into one div tag with an id and class. The HTML <span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes). This time it is used for the close button. &times means a multiplication sign. Thus the button will will appear as an X for the uses to click on to close the popup. In that div tag I used an image tag and I assigned it another class and id for the popup-content and the image.
